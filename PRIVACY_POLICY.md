# PureNet Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## Introduction

PureNet ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles information.

## Data Collection

**PureNet does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

- No browsing history is collected
- No personal information is gathered
- No data is sent to external servers
- No tracking or analytics are performed

## Local Storage

The extension uses Chrome's local storage API to store:
- **Blocked site count**: A simple counter of how many sites have been blocked (stored locally on your device only)
- **Extension settings**: Your preference for enabling/disabling the extension (stored locally on your device only)

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not shared with anyone
- Can be cleared by uninstalling the extension

## How It Works

PureNet uses Chrome's Declarative Net Request API to block adult websites. All blocking happens locally in your browser:
- No network requests are made
- No external services are contacted
- All rules are stored locally in the extension

## Permissions

PureNet requires the following permissions:

1. **declarativeNetRequest**: To block websites using Chrome's built-in blocking system
2. **storage**: To store local settings and statistics (all data stays on your device)
3. **host_permissions (<all_urls>)**: Required for the Declarative Net Request API to function

## Third-Party Services

PureNet does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Children's Privacy

PureNet is designed to help protect users, including children, from inappropriate content. We do not collect any information from users of any age.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date.

## Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the Chrome Web Store listing or the extension's support page.

## Compliance

This extension complies with:
- Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
